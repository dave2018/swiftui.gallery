# SwiftUI Gallery

## Contributions are welcome!

Just submit an [issue](https://github.com/zainhoda/swiftui-gallery/issues) with your code an screenshot

### Code
Code should be self-contained  (you should be able to copy and paste into a new SwiftUI project without adding assets)

### Screenshot
Submit a screenshot of the output of the code on an iPhone XR simulator. When you take the screenshot, use Cmd + Shift + 4 then space bar, then click the simulator window. This ensures that the preview images are all consistent.
